    <p id="main-paragraph">The Chinese language has two forms: <b>Traditional</b> and <b>Simplified</b>.</p> 
        <p id="main-paragraph"> The reason for this is because illiteracy had been a huge problem in China. The characters were too difficult for the majority of people to learn. In addition, there were no public schools, and the population was largely uneducated.</p> 
        <p id="main-paragraph">Back in the 1950's, after the Communist Party under Mao ZeDong took over, they decided to take high-frequency characters and simplify them by deleting or changing strokes so that they were easier to learn. In addition the government began to set up public schools.</p>
        <p id="main-paragraph">However, due to the political dispute between mainland China and Taiwan, as well as the British control of Hong Kong, and the reputation of communism abroad, Taiwan, Hong Kong, the U.S., Europe and other Chinese-speaking countries, like Singapore did not adopt the simplified characters at first. However, as of this writing, Taiwan is the final bastion using traditional characters.</p>
